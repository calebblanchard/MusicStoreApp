A retooled version of Assignment #1 from COS420 (Object-Oriented Design) course using JavaFX, Spring Boot, Hibernate and PostgreSQL.

The original assignment's specifications are being used as a guideline, but this app may diverge from them some, as it is meant to be its own thing. Instead of a Flower Shop, this app will be for a Music Store. 

Currently a work in progress.
